# Metro 2033 Config Editor

## Description

This is a config editor for the original version of Metro 2033 (not Redux) on Steam.
It allows you to edit most game settings as well as some hidden settings (such as FOV or windowed mode) without running the game.
It was made in C# using .NET 4.6.2 and Visual Studio 2017. You may need to install the Microsoft [.NET Framework 4.6.2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53344) to make it work.

## Installation

You can place the program anywhere on your computer. However, it'll be easier for game/Steam detection if it's placed in the game directory.

## Usage

1. Run the program.
2. Customize your settings.
3. Make sure all paths are specified.
4. Hit Save.
5. Run the game.

- You can reload the config by pressing the Reload button.
- You can use the Start game (non-Steam) button to run the game from the specified path.
- You can use the Start game (Steam) button to run the game using the Steam browser protocol.
