# Metro 2033 Config Editor
This is a config editor for the original version of Metro 2033 (not Redux) on Steam.

It allows you to edit the game settings as well as some hidden settings (such as FOV or windowed mode) without running the game.

It was made in C# using .NET 4.6.2 and Visual Studio 2017. You may need to install the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.2 to make it work.
