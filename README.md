# Metro2033ConfigEditor
This is a config editor for the original Steam version of Metro 2033.

It allows you to edit the game settings as well as some hidden settings (such as FOV or windowed mode) without running the game.

It was made in C# using .NET 4.6.2 and Visual Studio 2017. You may need to install the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.2 as well as the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2017 to make it work.
